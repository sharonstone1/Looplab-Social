# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

### This is a basic Bootstrap project

In this project, I am applying what I learned about the Bootstrap framework, specifically Bootstrap 5. The project will explore various features of Bootstrap 5, including modals, navigation bars, images, and more.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a thorough understanding of Bootstrap 5 features and to show how easy it is for non-front-end developers to design a simple static web application.

In this project, I enhanced the Scrollspy feature using JavaScript to enable users to scroll through sections with the cursor.

The images I used for this project were sourced from the Udemy Bootstrap Tutorial.
